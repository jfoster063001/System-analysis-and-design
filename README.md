# System-analysis-and-design

This project was called the DriverPass project which is designed to be a website that will help students pass their DMV test and their driving test.
My job was to gather the requirements of this task by speaking with the product owner and turning their wants and needs into an application.
I think a great strategy to designing software is to start with an OOP or object orientated model and start there to build out the system. After you make
the objects you will be able to connect them with proceeses which helps with expandability and with growth.
It is important to fit to the Product Owners wants and needs because it is their idea that they want to see expand and we are the tool to
help them bring their idea to fruition.
